# Kiyou

## Project description

<div style="text-align: justify"> 

I have been a professional singer for more than 10 years, 
and one of the things I most love about performing is interacting with my audience. To do that, 
I enjoy getting song suggestions from the public. However, this process is often not as efficient
as I would like. How it usually goes is:

</div>

1. I ask for song suggestions.
2. The audience writes the desired song on a paper.
3. The person gives it to the waiter.
4. The waiter gives the paper to me.
5. I evaluate the song suggestion.
6. Add the song to the queue.

<div style="text-align: justify"> 

Besides not being efficient, it is firstly not very ecological, given that lots of paper is "wasted"
for it to happen. Secondly, people often ask me to play songs that I am not comfortable playing, 
that are not in my repertoire, or that I already played previously. Still I cannot give this feedback 
to the person that asked for it.

With these issues and a need in mind, I decided to create Kiyou.

The audience window will allow the user to request songs for the artist. If the song was already played,
it will automatically be denied. If that is not the case, the songs will then automatically
be sent to the artist window. 

The artist window will allow the artist to deny or accept song requests, and list songs that were already played. 
If the song is denied, the artist
will have the option to give a feedback message. For example: "Sorry! This song is not on my repertoire, 
but I will try to learn it for next time!". If the song is accepted, the song will enter the queue, and 
the audience will receive the message "Your song request entered xxx artist's song queue".

The program will be used by artists like me and the audience present at the performance. With the program, 
song requests will be way more efficient.
